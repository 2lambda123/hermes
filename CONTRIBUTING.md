# Contributors guide

## Picking up issues

If you want to code something small in Hermes, search for `help wanted` tagged issues.

## Pull requests

* for small changes, no need to add separate issue, defining problem in pull request is enough
* create pull requests to **develop** branch
* it would be nice to squash commits before creating pull requests
* it's required to squash commits before merge
* pay attention to changing documentation in `docs/`
